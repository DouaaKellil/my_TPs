 ðŸ”¹TP C :
 This program implements some of basics of road map system using linked list
 It provides functions to:
   - Add cities and paths (direct or indirect).
   - Display the graph of cities and their connections.
   - Find reachable cities (directly or indirectly).
   - Check if a path exists between two cities and display it.
   - Find the shortest path between two cities.
   - Delete cities and their paths.
   - little of Load and save graph data from/to a file for persistence.
   - 
->  work is done individually.


ðŸ”¹TP ZxC:
 This lab implements optimized word search using 3 BST variants:
   - BST1: Rotates 'Y'/'Z'/'X' words to root
   - BST2: Moves 'Y'/'Z'/'X' words to mid-path
   - BST3: Rotates other words to root
 Key functions:
   - Single-word search (letter-based BST selection)
   - Range search [Word1,Word2] across BSTs
   - Performance comparison vs standard BST0 (statistics)
   - Random word generation (Nâ‰¥100 for basic, Nâ‰¥10,000 for simulation)
   - Z implementation + C translation
   - Outputs search path stats/efficiency metrics  
NOTE: Full labs specifications, examples and grading criteria are detailed in the complement PDF documents in folder "Lab announcement".

 -> work is done "in pairs".
